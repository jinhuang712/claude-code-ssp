/**
 * Test preload (wired up in bunfig.toml): points every directory the code can write to at a
 * throwaway temp root BEFORE any test module runs, so `bun test` can never touch the developer's
 * real ~/.claude (samples, caches, reset baselines, settings.json) or ~/.config/claude-code-super-statusline
 * (nor move a pre-0.4.0 ~/.config/claude-code-ssp to that name).
 *
 * Why these variables and not just HOME: Bun caches `os.homedir()` at startup, so changing HOME
 * here does not redirect the current process. Every write path, however, resolves through one of
 * the variables below at call time:
 *   - CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR      → data root (samples, git/transcript caches, resets) and settings.json
 *   - XDG_CONFIG_HOME        → user config dir (plugins dir, default config path)
 *   - CLAUDE_CODE_SSP_CONFIG → explicit user config file
 * HOME is still set so that child processes (the CLI budget test, git) start with the temp home.
 * `tests/isolation.test.ts` asserts the redirection actually holds.
