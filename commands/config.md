description: Open the claude-code-ssp statusline web configurator (starts the local server if needed)
allowed-tools: Bash(bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ssp.sh:*)
---

Run exactly this command and report its output to the user verbatim (one or two lines, no extra commentary):

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ssp.sh" config
```

It starts `claude-code-ssp serve` on 127.0.0.1:4877 if it is not already running and opens the browser.
If it fails, show the log excerpt it prints and suggest `bun install` inside the plugin root.
